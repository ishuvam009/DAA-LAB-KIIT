DAA Lab-1 (Using function)

Q1. Given an array. Let us assume that there can be duplicates element. Write a program to find an
element in the list in such a way that we get the highest frequency if there are duplicates.

Q2. Write a program for finding i and j in an array A for any key such that A[j] 2 + A[i] 2 == key

Q3. Given key in a sorted array A with distinct values. Write a program to find i, j, k such that A[i] + A[j] +
A[k] == key.

Q4. Suppose an array A has n distinct integers. Increasing sequence is given as A[1].........A[k] and
decreasing sequence is given as A[k+1]........A[n]. Write a program for finding k.

Q5. Write a program to display an array of n integers (n&gt;1) in O(n) time, where at every index of the
array should contain the product of all elements in the array except the element at the given index. No
additional array declaration is allowed.
Example: Input : 10, 4, 1, 6, 2 Output : 48,120,480,80,240

DAA Lab-2 (Using function)
1. Write a program to store ransom numbers into an array of n integers, find out the smallest and
largest number stored in it. N is inputted by the user.
2. Write a program to rearrange the elements of an array of n integers, such that all the even
numbers are followed by all odd numbers. How many different ways you can solve this problem.
Write your approaches and strategy for solving this problem.
3. WAP that takes 3 variables(a,b,c) as separate parameters and rotate the values stores so that a
goes to b, b to c and c to a. By using swap(int, int), that swap exchanges the nos x and y.
4. Let A be the square matrix. WAP by using appropriate user defined function for the following.
a. Find the no. of non-zero elements in A.
b. Find the sum of elements above the leading diagonal.
c. Display the elements bellow the minor diagonal.
d. Find the product of the diagonal elements.
