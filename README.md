DAA Lab-1 (Using function)

Q1. Given an array. Let us assume that there can be duplicates element. Write a program to find an
element in the list in such a way that we get the highest frequency if there are duplicates.
Q2. Write a program for finding i and j in an array A for any key such that A[j] 2 + A[i] 2 == key
Q3. Given key in a sorted array A with distinct values. Write a program to find i, j, k such that A[i] + A[j] +
A[k] == key.
Q4. Suppose an array A has n distinct integers. Increasing sequence is given as A[1].........A[k] and
decreasing sequence is given as A[k+1]........A[n]. Write a program for finding k.
Q5. Write a program to display an array of n integers (n&gt;1) in O(n) time, where at every index of the
array should contain the product of all elements in the array except the element at the given index. No
additional array declaration is allowed.
Example: Input : 10, 4, 1, 6, 2 Output : 48,120,480,80,240
